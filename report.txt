Enhancing Retrieval and Generation in GraphRAG: A Case Study in the Financial Domain

Introduction
During this internship phase, I conducted an in-depth study on GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with the objective of improving information retrieval and question answering performance in large-scale unstructured document collections, particularly within high-specialization domains such as finance. Through systematic experiments and comparative analysis, my work focused on optimizing two key metrics: recall and precision. Leveraging the reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), I proposed and validated several optimization strategies: employing a sliding window mechanism to guide the LLM in “reading with the question,” thereby substantially boosting recall; integrating a generative retriever into the LLM prompt to effectively reduce retrieval noise and outperform conventional reranker models; identifying and introducing the page_index method as a viable alternative to GraphRAG in the financial domain, enabling efficient retrieval without requiring detailed table contents; and reframing user inference-type questions into extraction-type queries during the answer generation phase to improve accuracy. These findings not only provide practical enhancements for GraphRAG in domain-specific settings but also offer methodological insights for broader applications of retrieval-augmented generation across multiple fields.
